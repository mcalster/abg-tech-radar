CLIs,techniques,Adopt,"Product should, where possible, expose functionality via a CLI."
RESTful APIs,techniques,Adopt,A REST architectural style is our default choice for building web APIs. Deviations can be made when it makes sense to do so.
Infrastructure as code,techniques,Adopt,Infrastructure should be provisioned through code rather than manually (except for ad-hoc testing)
Automated code style settings,techniques,Adopt,Codebases should be formatted consistently. Automated code-style settings achieve this without fuss.
Static code analysis (linters),techniques,Adopt,Static code analysis is invaluable for automatically checking for problems in code. We use ESLint for JS and Roslyn-based analyzers for .NET. We also experimented with SonarQube but our implementation wasn't giving us confidence.

Git Ops,techniques,Assess,"The core idea of GitOps is having a Git repository that always contains declarative descriptions of the infrastructure currently desired in the production environment and an automated process to make the production environment match the described state in the repository. If you want to deploy a new application or update an existing one, you only need to update the repository - the automated process handles everything else. It’s like having cruise control for managing your applications in production. <a href='https://www.gitops.tech/'>Read more</a>, currently being trialled for Platform Hosted"
DAPR,langlib,Assess,"DAPR (Distributed Application Runtime - <a href='https://dapr.io/'>https://dapr.io/</a>) is an abstraction layer for use in a distributed application, currently being trialled by Platform for both Hosted and Enterprise. It is used to standardise how to communicate external systems in such a way we can uniformly add features through the DAPR sidecar"
Axon,langlib,Assess,"<a href='https://developer.axoniq.io/'>Axon</a>) is an abstraction layer for use in a Domain Driven Design development methodology. Axon provides a unified, productive way of developing Java applications that can evolve without significant refactoring from a monolith to Event-Driven microservices."
Asynchronous state management in React,techniques,Adopt,"Asynchronous state management in React should be delegated to a third-party framework such as <a href='https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/overview'>react-query</a>. This avoids manual management of promises' states (e.g. loading/errors), and allows using suspense and error boundaries in modern React."
